You just hit me with the truth
Now girl you're more than welcome to
So give me one good reason
Baby come on
I've lived for you and me
And now I really come to see
That life would be much better once you're gone
I know that I can't take no more
It ain't no lie
I want to see you out that door
Baby bye bye bye
